# Verify a file

In this challenge you'll create a file with a module that is verified by the adventuretron app.

This module should be a function that takes a string as its only argument.

Retun an object with one property named `adventure`. Set that property's value to the string argument.

For example:

```
module.exports = function (text) {
  return { adventure: text }
}
```
